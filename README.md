##My DISMATH Weekly Portfolio
##Week 1
- I was introduced to the course Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH).
- Personally, I feel the need to give an extra effort in this subject if I want to get a high grade. This course isn't like the normal math.

##Week 2
- We discussed new and old terms such as: proof, proposition, logical deduction, axiom, premises, and axiom of equality.
- We also discussed logical connectives: negation, conjuction, disjunction, exclusive or, conditional, and biconditional.
- We also discussed propositional variables and the truth table.
- We also discussed logical equivalances: identity, domination, negation, double negation, idempotent, commulative, associative, distributive, de Morgan's, and absorption.
- Personally, I valued note taking this week. I relied on the ebook. I realized that copying notes can help you learn how to do he process and not just the concept of a topic.

##Week 3
- We discussed predicate logic; propositional logic; quantifiers: universal quantifier, existential quantifier; rules of inference: argument, valid, fallacy; and tautology.
- So far, we've discussed the truth table, logic equivalnces, quantifiers, and rules of inference.
- We also discussed validity.
- We also discussed the rules of inference: modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, disjunctive syllogism, addition, and simplification.
- Personally, I felt happy that I got the chance to redeem myself from the previous week when I was asked on how to do a certain problem and I wasn't able to answer because I didn't copy notes- this week, I answered sir's question and gave the process.

##Week 4
- I learned about Predicate Logic that teaches us to tackle an argument not as a whole but in terms of subject and predicate
- We were also introduced to Quantifiers, Existential Quantifier ("There Exist") and Universal Quantifier ("For All"), to simplify general arguments 
- We discuused their main components as: argument, validity, and pattern.
- We also discussed the 5 proofs: direct, contraposition, vacuous & trivial, contradiction, and equivalence.
- Personally, this is the hardest week for me. But I am determined that "If I study hard, I will get a high scire in the exam."
