##My DISMATH Weekly Portfolio
##Week 1
- I was introduced to the course Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH).

##Week 2
- We discussed new and old terms such as: proof, proposition, logical deduction, axiom, premises, and axiom of equality.
- We also discussed logical connectives: negation, conjuction, disjunction, exclusive or, conditional, and biconditional.
- We also discussed propositional variables and the truth table.
- We also discussed logical equivalances: identity, domination, negation, double negation, idempotent, commulative, associative, distributive, de Morgan's, and absorption.

##Week 3
- We discussed predicate logic; propositional logic; quantifiers: universal quantifier, existential quantifier; rules of inference: argument, valid, fallacy; and tautology.
- So far, we've discussed the truth table, logic equivalnces, quantifiers, and rules of inference.
- We also discussed validity.
- We also discussed the rules of inference: modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, disjunctive syllogism, addition, and simplification.

##Week 4
- I learned about Predicate Logic that teaches us to tackle an argument not as a whole but in terms of subject and predicate
- We were also introduced to Quantifiers, Existential Quantifier ("There Exist") and Universal Quantifier ("For All"), to simplify general arguments 
- We discuused their main components as:argument, validity, and pattern.
